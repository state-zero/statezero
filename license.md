_Last Updated: 2025-06-29_

## **1. Copyright and Ownership**

1.1. **StateZero is proprietary software** developed and owned by **Hoza Holdings Pte Ltd** ("Licensor").
1.2. **StateZero is not open-source.** All rights not expressly granted in this License are **reserved by the Licensor**.
1.3. **Distribution**: StateZero is made available via **PyPI** (Python Package Index), **npm** (Node Package Manager), and **GitHub**.
1.4. **Early Release Status**: This is an **early release version** of StateZero designed for community feedback. It is **not considered production ready**. Users are encouraged to provide feedback but should exercise caution when implementing in critical systems.

## **2. Commercial No-Rugpull License**

2.1. **No-Rugpull Guarantee**: StateZero is available under a commercial "no-rugpull" license, which means:

- You receive an **irrevocable right** to use StateZero forever for a fixed monthly fee
- We **cannot change your fee**, other than a fixed CPI (Consumer Price Index) increase that's automatically added each year
- As long as you pay the fee and don't build a competitive product, the license will continue
- If we no longer wish to be associated with your use case, we will ask you not to pay the fee, but **your license will remain valid**

  2.2. **License Philosophy**: If SaaS is like renting and open-source is like owning, our license is like a **999-year leasehold on fixed rent**. It provides the security you need to build and grow your company around StateZero, while allowing us to maintain and develop StateZero to a high standard.

  2.3. **Rate Lock Guarantee**: You lock in the **full rate card for all tiers** at the time you sign up, meaning your fees remain predictable no matter how much your revenue or our pricing changes. To lock in your rates, simply contact us at **robert@statezero.dev**.
